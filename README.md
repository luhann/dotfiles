# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for zsh, KDE, Firefox, and more.

## Management

I use [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinking my dotfiles on new machines. The folders are structured so that I just have to run (for example) `stow i3` to have all my i3 configs symlinked to the correct place. 

## Desktop Environment
I currently use plasma on openSUSE Tumbleweed with i3 as my window manager.
